# User should be able to save their own notes on a Book. Where should these live?
# A book can be shared across multiple shelves, so I don't feel that it should be
# a field on bookshelf.
#
# I feel like it should be it's own entity, and fetched in tandem with the shelf.
# So BookDetails becomes its own table where each table has a unique owner and
# unique book associated with it.
